# ASTR-150-Lab-1
Analysis of Nickel Telescope Data


The code makes heavy use of numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, glob, and astropy to analyze numerous .fits files that contain data from the Nickel 1 m telescope. 

Multiple files are created in running this code, such as the corrected .fits files. Make sure that you have permission to read and write to the directory that you are trying to run the code in to make sure that there are no issues.
